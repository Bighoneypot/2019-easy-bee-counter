# Data

I've got some amazing data out of this over the years but it takes constant calibration for a number or reasons
 - bees don't seem to add propolis to sensors but will spend several days filling voids and messing with sensors upon initial installation
 - bearding in the summer evenings and guard bees mulling about give false triggers
 - direct sun light at a low angle will false trigger sensors (this can be mitigated pretty easily)


My best results have been measuring the speed of the bees movement and only count known movements and throwing out all false triggers. The method misses a lot of bees but can give consistent values. It takes a bee about 180-350ms to traverse the sensor region.
