# Data

I've got some amazing data over the years but it takes constant calibration for a number or reasons
 - bees don't add propolis to sensors but will spend several days filling voids with propolis upon initial installation
 - bearding in the summer evenings and general guard bees mulling about give false triggers
 - direct sun light at a low angle will false trigger sensors (this can be mitigated pretty easily)

Possible uses:
- the rate of expansion or decline of bee flights might indicate hive health
- the expansion of decline of orientation flights over days might signal queen health
- the time shift between peaks of bees leaving and returning might indicate number of foragers and distance to polen/nectar source.

## Hive health
Equating bee flight data and orientation flights to over all hive health or queen health seems possible. Orientation flights is a behavior of 'middle aged' bees about [20 days old](https://www.arnia.co.uk/honey-bee-orientation/#). Before foraging these bees will leave the hive as a group at around mid day resulting in an easy to see ~45min peak in data.

If there is a drop in orientation flights do to a queen loss there might be a 20 day lag before any flight data might represent this.

## Foraging distance
It's easy to see small but distinct shifts between bees OUT and bees IN. This indicates both a volume of bees that are leaving and returning together as well as a rough time or distance to the foraging location.
