## Ordering from JLCPCB

There are a lot of different PCB manufacturers to choose from. These instructions show JLCPCB. You need a manufacturer that can make black PCBs if you want to use the PCBs to make a sandwhich. The IR LEDs/sensors need to point to a black surface to prevent false triggers, so the bottom PCB has to be black.

1. Choose which footprint you want. ItsyBitsy or Feather. Download the latest zipped gerber files.
