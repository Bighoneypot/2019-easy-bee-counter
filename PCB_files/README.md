## Printed Circuit Board (PCB)

This PCB version has two footprints that accept the wider (0.8") Adafruit Feather micro-controllers such as the [esp32](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3405) and the narrower (0.6")[Adafruit ItsyBitsy](https://www.adafruit.com/category/1008) micro-controllers.

These files were created in Autocad EAGLE PCB software. The zipped files are the gerber files needed by the PCB manufacturer.

Right click and 'save link as' to download the files and then upload them to the PCB manufacturer. See the [ordering instructions here](https://github.com/hydronics2/2019-easy-bee-counter/tree/master/instructions/ordering_instructions). Most board shops require a minimum order of 3-5 boards and you'll need 2 boards to sandwich together to complete one bee counter.
